## Data 
The data was extracted from the Citi Bike Data page.  The data used was every 2 months since 2021.  Note, this data is incomplete for 2023, as the year has not yet completed. The datasets were joined using concat in Tableau_Base.ipynb located in this folder. Note, the orignal datasets are not in Github due to size of the original csvs.

## Analysis

There are two dashboards included in my viz.  The Station Start Dashboard shows details containing the most and least common places to pick up a citi bike.  The top station, Grove St Path, is almost 2x higher in volume than the 5th highest station.  Which means the top few start stations are responsible for a large amount of volume.  Also, the volume of riders is increasing YOY, but the month trend is consistent YOY. 

The second dashboard, looks at end station data.  The End Station Dashboard also shows Grove St Path as the most popular station.  Also, we can see in this dashboard that there are much more end stations populating in the Open Street Map.  This is interesting because it looks like most of these stations are outside of Manhattan.
